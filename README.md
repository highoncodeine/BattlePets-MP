# BattlePets-MP
A machine project game.

Be the very best like no one ever was!
BattlePets is a text-based game that draws inspiration from Battleship, Pokemon, and Tic-Tac-Toe mechanics. Players are
to form a 3x3 BattlePet roster wherein the arrangement is secret to the other player (inspired by Battleship). Each
BattlePet fights its counterpart in the same grid position (inspired by Pokemon). The overall match winner is determined
based on who has the most BattlePet wins out of the nine battles. However, a lucky win may be declared if the
arrangement of a playerâ€™s BattlePet wins is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal (inspired by Tic-Tac-Toe), regardless of
whether the opposing player has the most wins in total for that match.
